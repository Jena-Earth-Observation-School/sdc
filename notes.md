# Recommendations

- Put `import` statements at the top of your notebook. Keep only the ones that are actually necessary to run the code of the notebook. 
- Follow PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
- Experimenting and running cells out of order is fine, however, at the end of the day (or when you finish developing something) the notebook cells should be in order so that execution from top to bottom is possible without errors.
- Experimentation -> Cleanup -> Reproducible Code
- Cleanup unnecessary code cells after experimenting
- Condense code from multiple cells together where it makes sense
- If either code becomes too long and/or code is reused (in some form or another) in the project -> Extract to functions / modules!
- Use Markdown features of the notebooks. Create sections and WRITE inside of your notebooks to explain the code that you have written so that others (and your future self) can understand it.
