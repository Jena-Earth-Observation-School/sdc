# `sdc-tools`

`sdc-tools` is a collection of tools for working with the SALDi Data Cube (SDC), which is hosted on the Draco HPC 
cluster at the University of Jena and contains various Earth Observation data sets for the six study areas of the 
[SALDi project](https://www.saldi.uni-jena.de/en).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://jena-earth-observation-school.github.io/sdc-tools) for more information on
how to install and use the package.

Access to the SDC is restricted to employees and students affiliated with the Department for Earth Observation of the 
University of Jena, however, some tools might still be useful for others who are working with similar data sets.
